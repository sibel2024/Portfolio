## About Me
I am Sibel, a Junior Software Developer with a passion for solving complex problem through coding. My goal is to continue growing my skills in backend development and databases.

## Projects
Here are the some projects that I worked on:
1) Simple Calculator
I created a comand-line calculator that performs basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. For this project, I used JavaScript and ran the application in a Node.js environment. I utilized the readline library to handle terminal input and output, ensuring smooth interaction with the user.

2) Weather Application
I developed a web app that allows users to search for weather by city, fetching real-time data using the Fetch API in JavaScript. I applied asynchronous JavaScript, handled JSON data from APIs, and implemented error handling. The app uses HTML, CSS and JavaScript to create a dynamic, user-friendly interface

3) Breakdown Database
I developed a database system to manage a breakdown service company. This project tracks members, vehicles, assigned engineers, and breakdown incidents, ensuring efficient service handling and reporting. I used SQL for database queries, joins, and data manipulation, ensuring high organization and data accuracy.

4) Expense Tracker
I created a Python program that efficiently tracks daily expenses by allowing users to log amounts, categorize them, and view a summary of their spending. I used Python's functions, loops, dictionaries, and input validation to create a modular, easy-to-use, and efficient tool for personal expense management.
